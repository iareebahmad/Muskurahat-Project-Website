> _“During a crisis, there are three types of people:_  
> 1️⃣ Those who say, *'I don't care what happens to other people as long as it doesn't affect me.'*  
> 2️⃣ Those who think, *'How can I rip people off and make money from this?'*  
> 3️⃣ Those who ask, *'How can I help?'*  
> **Always be the third one.**_

## 💡 Our Philosophy

There are two simple yet powerful truths that many forget or don’t know:

- When you give selflessly, you are likely to receive in return — not necessarily materially, but in goodwill and positive energy.  
- True kindness comes from genuine motives, not from expecting something back. Giving with a pure heart is the real secret to spreading joy and making a difference.
